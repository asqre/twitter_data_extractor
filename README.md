					  Install Python
 					  This happen in linux OS. So, I switched to windows OS

2. pip is not recognized while installing selenium(pip install selenium) in vs code terminal.
					  To do so, we just set up the environment path.
                                To check where python and their scripts are installed. Just run commands "py -m pip"(we can't find the path manually, coz it is hidden)
 					  Just copy the path
							C:\Users\VICTUS\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311
          						C:\Users\VICTUS\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts
       				  and setup the environment variables. and restart the vscode

3. Now run command in vscode terminal (pip install selenium).

					  go to selenium.org
 					  install chrome driver (https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/?pli=1) assuring the version must be match to your chrome version.
